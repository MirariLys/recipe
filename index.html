       <h2>Cookies Recipe</h2> 
       <h4>Ingredients needed:</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Egg, 1 unit</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter, 115g</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar, 100g</li>
        <li>Brown sugar, 165g</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, 155g</li>
        <li>Chocolate chips, 110g</li>
        <li>Dark chocolate chunks, 110g</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract, 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Baking soda, 1/2 tsp</li>
        <li>Salt, 1 tsp</li>
       </ul>
       <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt and butter until a apaste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavour and deeper colour, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavour will be.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180degC. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-creams scoop onto a parchment paer-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10cm) of space between the cookies and 2 inches (5cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
